Welcome to Lost Marble source code.

This is a game I made with Unreal Engine 4.26. It's a Top-Down game where you can control a marble stone. Your goal is to find all crystals in the game and escape the underworld. I'm making this game open source to let other developers see how I made this game and learn from it.

You can download the game through the [itch.io](https://amirrezapayandeh.itch.io/lost-marble) page.

**Is the game going to be updated in the future?**

This project was just a fun game I made in my spare time. I won't make any further updates. Instead you can download this source code and make updates and let me know to add your update to the game.
